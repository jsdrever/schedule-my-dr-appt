This project will be a daily planner. it will default to open on the current day of the week. Timeblocks will divide the day and use colors to indicate past present and future respectively.
The user will be able to add new events by clicking on the time they want and typing the message. By clicking save the information goes to local storage and refreshes the page.

Also maybe add a clear list button if we have time
